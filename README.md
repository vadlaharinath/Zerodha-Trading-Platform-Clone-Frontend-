# React + Vite
# Zerodha Trading Platform Clone (Frontend)

This project is a **frontend clone of the Zerodha trading platform**, developed with **React.js**.  
It simulates Zerodha‚Äôs clean UI and implements essential trading dashboard functionalities along with **authentication and routing**.  

The goal of this project is to practice **frontend development with React**, implement **JWT-based authentication**, and structure code using **reusable components**.

---

## Objectives
- Build a modern UI inspired by Zerodha
- Implement authentication to allow only authorized users
- Organize code with reusable React components
- Navigate between pages using **React Router DOM**
- Protect routes so users cannot access the app without login

---

##  Features
-  **JWT Authentication**
  - Validates user login and issues an **access token**
  - Only authorized users can access the dashboard and inner routes
-  **Component-based Development**
  - Each UI feature is built as a **separate component file** in React
  - Ensures clean, maintainable, and reusable code
-   **Navigation with React Router DOM**
  - After login, users are redirected to the **dashboard**
  - Uses nested routes to organize multiple pages like Orders, GTT, Baskets, SIP, Alerts
-   **Protected Routes**
  - Prevents direct access to dashboard without authentication
  - Ensures secure navigation across components
-   **Responsive Layout**
  - Optimized for desktop and mobile devices
